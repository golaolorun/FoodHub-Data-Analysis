# FoodHub-Data-Analysis
FoodHub is a food aggregator company that offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. 
Restaurants typically receive orders from customers and the app assigns a delivery person to pick up and deliver to customers. 
As the number of restaurants in New York is increasing and lots of busy professionals rely on online food delivery services, FoodHub seeks to use available data to understand the demands of restaurants, enhance customers' experiences, and improve its business.
As a result, an exploratory data analysis was carried out with Python to explore the data, answer some business questions, and ultimately provide valuable insights/recommendations.
